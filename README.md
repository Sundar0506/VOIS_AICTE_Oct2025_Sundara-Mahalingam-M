Airbnb Data Analysis & Clustering
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb open data to uncover insights into property listings, pricing, availability, and customer reviews. Using clustering techniques, the project groups listings into meaningful categories to help identify trends in different neighborhoods, pricing ranges, and booking behaviors.

🎯 Objectives

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on raw Airbnb dataset

Handle missing values and ensure data consistency

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Apply KMeans clustering to group listings based on numerical attributes

Derive insights on pricing patterns, availability, and customer engagement

👥 End Users

Travelers looking for suitable and affordable stays

Hosts/Owners to optimize pricing and availability

Tourism Boards to study neighborhood trends

Researchers & Analysts for urban and tourism studies

🛠️ Technology Used

Python – core programming language

Pandas & NumPy – data preprocessing and cleaning

Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualization and EDA

Scikit-learn – clustering (KMeans) and scaling

Google Colab – cloud-based execution environment

📂 Dataset

Source: Airbnb Open Data (CSV format)

Shape: ~100k rows and 26 columns

Key attributes: price, minimum_nights, number_of_reviews, reviews_per_month, availability_365, etc.

📊 Key Findings

Identified pricing patterns across neighborhoods

Classified properties into 3 distinct clusters using KMeans

Revealed relationships between availability, reviews, and pricing

Highlighted host and neighborhood-level insights

🚀 How to Run the Project

Open Google Colab

Upload the dataset (Airbnb_Open_Data.csv)

📌 Future Scope

Apply advanced clustering methods (DBSCAN, Hierarchical)

Build a recommendation system for travelers

Deploy as a web app/dashboard for real-time exploratio
